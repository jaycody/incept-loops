synthetic unity of neural net apperception 
______________________________________________

##Inspired by Inceptionism

Researchers at Google discovered that neural nets trained for image recognition, when turned upside down, could sythesize their own version of the image they're trained to detect.  

So for neural nets and humans alike, the old addage is true.  We see things not as they are but as we are.

If only Immanual Kant were here to see this -->  A critique of pure A.I. reason and the synthetic unity of neural net apperception.

##Papers
- [Going Deeper with Convolutions]
     - We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed Incep- tion, which was responsible for setting the new state of the art for classification and detection
- [Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualizing IMage Classification Models and Saliency Maps] - the visualisation of image classification models
- [Inverting Convolutional Networks with Convolutional Networks] - a new approach to study deep image representations by inverting them with an up-convolutional neural network.
- [Understanding Deep Image Representations by Inverting Them] - given an encoding of an image, to which extent is it possible to reconstruct the image itself?
